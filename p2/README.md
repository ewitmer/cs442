# Project 2: Automated Reasoning
The objective of this assignment was to design and develop a program two theorem provers: basic model checking and propositional resolution

## Getting Started
The following will guide you through the file structure so that you can get a copy running locally.

### Prerequisites
You will need Python3 installed on your computer. You can run this in any virtual environment since there are no requirements outside of core Python.

### Installing

Copy the src folder to your machine.

Navigate into the directory

```
cd src
```

And run python3 problems.py

```
python3 problems.py
```
All of the questions and answers will run in the console. Please note that the full script takes about 5 minutes to run, but you will know it is still running because the number of resolution clauses currently being analyzed will print to the console.

#### File Structure 
```bash
/src
|-- basic.py
|-- KB.py
|-- Node.py
|-- parse_logic.py
|-- problems.py  
|-- resolution.py
```
Additional information regarding the  output analysis is available in the report (report.pdf).
