This is a sample coding project from [CS442](https://web.archive.org/web/20191031110434/https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/apurtee/442/syllabus.html), an Artificial Intelligence class I took as part of my Master's in Computer Science degree program at the University of Rochester in Fall, 2019.

The [assignment]('p2/assignment.pdf') was related to the study of automated reasoning, or the ability to infer new knowledge based on existing knowledge.

Reviewing this code as a more experienced engineer, I see several ways in which it could be improved. At the time I wrote this, I was a self-taught programmer with no relevant work experience and an undergraduate degree and work experience in an unrelated domain. Considering that, I believe this work shows:

* A creative approach to problem solving (implementing the solution with a tree structure)
* Attention to detail (implementing basic testing which was not required for the projects)
* Going above and beyond (implementing the two extra credit opportunities)
* An ability to write clear [technical documentation](p2/writeup/report.pdf)
* An ability to [simplify and clearly communicate](p2/writeup/nontech_summary.pdf) highly technical or complex ideas

I am sharing his project because I believe it demonstrates that I possess not only technical skills, but also the "hard to teach" intangibles and soft skills invaluable to contributing and growing as a more senior engineer.
